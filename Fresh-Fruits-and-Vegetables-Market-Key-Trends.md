The fresh fruits and vegetables market is undergoing significant transformations in 2024, driven by consumer preferences, technological advances and sustainability initiatives. Recent studies indicate that the global fresh produce market is expected to reach approximately $2 trillion by 2026, highlighting the rapid growth of the sector.
